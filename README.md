Instructions for Source Code: IDE: Jupyter Notebook File:
cs666\_project.ipynb

    - Download Jupyter Notebook
        - Use https://jupyter.org/ for reference. 
    - Upload jupyter notebook file (source code) to IDE
        - Reference to source code and results are in this link: https://github.com/leyulin/entropy_project/blob/main/cs666_project.ipynb
    - Run File in Jupyter Notebook

    Note: We tried to upload the whole dataset to github but was rejected due to sizing constraints(100MB). For our experiment, we took partial data from the original computed dataset for demonstration purposes. The running result is already displayed in jupyter notebook and follows the execution flow. To rerun source code, run each cell from the top (one by one). 

Responsibilities Research The research in our project was extensive.
Everyone in the group took part in finding and reading sources,
formulating valid points and hypotheses, and constructing the research
paper.

    Experimentation
        The experimentation consisted of 4 main steps.
            Step 1: Data Preprocessing
            Step 2: Computation of Entropy
            Step 3: Evaluation of Attributes
            Step 4: Training the Model 

            Leyu Lin focused on Step 1, Step 2, and Step 4.  
            Parth Thummar focused on Step 3, Step 2, and Step 4.

    Testing
        Extensive testing was done. Everyone in the group took part in testing the results, the computational components in the project (such as entropy and evaluation of attributes), and the source code (with code reviews). 

    Writing
        The paper was written by the entire group and proof read extensively.
